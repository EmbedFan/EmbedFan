- 👋 Hi, I’m Attila Gallai alias @EmbedFan


- 👀 I’m interested in developing a lot kind of embedded systems with my friends. I love to program really unique designed target boards but I'm feeling at home on 
boards populated with ARM architecture MCU or any other 8, 16, or 32 bits MCUs. I also love to program Raspberry PIs.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to desing program for trusted embedded systems, my job is on this area too, how to design and implement sophisticated software tests for embedded systems.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating smart house projects, really. I would be your service provider to design and develop uniqu modules and trusted remoote controlled systens.
